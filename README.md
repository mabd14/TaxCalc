# TaxCalc
A simple tax calculator I built using Java
It allows the user to input their income and checks how much they are taxed.
The tax brackets are:
• 0% tax on the first £15000
• 5% tax for anything over £15000 and less or equal to £30000
• 20% tax for anything over £30000 and less or equal to £50000
• 40% tax for anything over £50000

The total tax on someone who earns 50_000 should be taxed a total of £4750.
